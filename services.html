					<h2 class="title">Individual and Organization Registration Assistance</h2>
					<p class="homepage-content">
						One of the most confusing and frustrating steps in the application process is completing the government registration process.  To apply for federal government grants, applicants must complete an exhaustive multi-step registration process that can take several weeks.  Application mistakes or omissions can result in delays or registration denials.  
					</p>
					<p class="homepage-content">
							Our team has a proven background guiding our customers through the registration process.  We can help you register for:
					<ul>
						<li>Dun and Bradstreet</li>
						<li>System for Award Management</li>
						<li>Grants.gov</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="title">Post-Award Project Implementation and Management Assistance</h2>
					<p class="homepage-content">
						The LDA Team understands that the work on your grant doesn’t stop at the point of submission. Grant Agencies are often unclear regarding next steps, what to expect, timelines and processes, yet they expect you to be in compliance. LDA provides full service support, ensuring your grant is tracked throughout the review process until the award announcements. Instructions and information on drawing down your funds, submitting paperwork, and other compliance measures are provided helping to ensure that you get your funds, and stay in good stead with the granting agency. LDA can also help you to navigate the complex issue of procurement and fair & open competition 
						as dictated by OMB.
